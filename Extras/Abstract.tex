This paper explains and details the decisions and approaches taken to build a Multi-Label Classifier using Artificial Neural Networks based on Deep Learning techniques and deep music features to establish and predict the genre/s of a given song. 

The proposed method is based on Machine Learning techniques focused on Artifical Neural Networks. These networks try to learn tasks by emulating the way the human brain works. This set of algorithms are reasonably new and provide a yet to explore tools in the Artificial Intelligence field.

This paper aims to explain and analyze the accuracy and results obtained and might be used as a baseline for further music-related projects relying on classification techniques, such as recommender systems or sentiment analysis that could be enriched with the results of this paper.
