I would like to thank every person who has made possible I could achieve my goals and become the person that I am today, especially my family and friends that have supported me over the years with continuous encouragement and kindness.

Thanks to my tutor, Carmen, that always helped and guided me during the entire process of this thesis even though I got stuck along the way.

Lastly, I would like to thank the random people over the internet that made their resources publicly available so others could use and consume them with documents, libraries, guides and an endless source of information free to use.
